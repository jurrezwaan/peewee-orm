<p>We have a craving for food and want to explore the restaurant scene. We are aware that there is a database with all the data we need to make our choices for food. We want to
use an ORM and its functions to query the database.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first step is to determine how the mapping between the database and python is. Take a look at the <code>models.py</code> file. Replace all <code>...</code>s with
appropriate fields. Consult the Peewee documentation. Assume that all fields that are not already filled in, have no constraints.</li>
<li>Once the mapping between the database tables and the python models is done, you can start work on the queries. These are located in the <code>main.py</code> file. The expected
results for all queries are defined in the function comments. All you have to do is complete the functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can check your result with <code class="interpreted-text" role="command">wincpy check</code>.</p></div></center>
